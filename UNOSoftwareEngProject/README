Code for a project I did as part of a group in the Spring semester of 2015
  -class was CSCI 4830, Introduction to Software Engineering

Our project was to make a site that allowed users to vote on and create reviews about bioinformatics tools.  So this would be a similar idea to the site RateMyProfessor except rating bioinformatics tools instead of schools and professors.
  The site would allow sorting of tools by category, voting on tools, reviews of tools, and submissions of suggestions for new tools and/or categories.
  We utilized Django and Heroku for this.
